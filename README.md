# Tic Tac Toe

Your task is to create a tic tac toe simulation. The game should be a command line program in Python 3. An example of what the program could look like can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/AGKpN_YRxjw. This assignment has several learning objectives but there are two primary goals. 

1) Students will be able to effectively use a list data structure in a program.
    1) You should initialize at least one list to store the state of the board.
    2) You will need to access elements of the list to determine if there was a winner.
2) Students will be able to decompose a problem into smaller sub problems.
    1) Tic Tac Toe is a very simple game to play. However, it is not always as simple to program simple tasks. Start by playing the game. I recommend that in your groups, you start by assigning 3 roles, the referee (multiple members can be the referee), the X player and the O player. Think of the referee as the CPU, you will need to think about every single action that they do during a game of Tic Tac Toe. 
    2) Start to break the game of Tic Tac Toe into very small steps.
    3) Once you have the steps of the game outlined, only then should you start to translate those steps into code.
    

## Research
Resist the urge to search: Tic Tac Toe in Python. That defeats the entire point of the project. If you get stuck, you should lean on your group mates first, the python documentation https://docs.python.org second, and finally your teacher third. You should not use terms related to Tic Tac Toe for any research. Remember that the goals is not for you to copy someone else's implementation of Tic Tac Toe, but to come up with your own. This is what real computer science is about, solving problems using a computer.
